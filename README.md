# eos-scatter-vanilla-auth
EOS and Scatter basic signup example with vanilla es6 :)

Also, the signup is being done on the application server side with a EOSRPC wrapper
so if you want to keep the signup functionality you can just implement it on your
server or follow the 
[account creation steps with eos.js here](https://github.com/EOSEssentials/Scatter-Demos/blob/master/src/views/GettingStarted.vue#L218).

## Installation

npm install
npm start
